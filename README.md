This is assignment 1b  

We first created variables to hold the akan names for both male and female for all seven days of the week.
 We wrote three functions namely function sharon, function first and function getTheDay.
 Function sharon takes in "$scope" as a parameter, gets the day and gender of the user who logs in and returns the user's akan name.
 Function first takes the birthday and gender of the user as a parameter, with akan name as a variable, it uses if else statements to validate the akan name. If the is a male it gives a male name depending on the birthday of the user and likewise for females.
 Function getTheDay takes in ($date) as a parameter. With myDays and myDate as variable it takes the birthdate and returns the birthday of the user.
